# wikipediaviewer
This Program is a search tool for wikipedia.
--------------------------------------------
Clicking on "random" will pop up a random wikipedia page.
Entering a query into the form box and clicking on "Search Wikipeida"
will display 10 tiles under the search bar.
Each tile will represent a query made to wikipedia's API, and will display a short description of the page that the hyperlink will lead too, and a hyperlink to the page.

This line added to check git diff.
